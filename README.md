## The Problem

Retail businesses often struggle with:

1. **Understanding Customer Behavior:** Who are our most valuable customers, and how do they interact with our business?
2. **Optimizing Sales Performance:** How can we identify trends and areas for improvement in our sales strategy?
3. **Predicting Future Performance:** Can we forecast future sales and customer retention rates?

To address these challenges, I analyzed a retail dataset and provided clear, actionable solutions.
